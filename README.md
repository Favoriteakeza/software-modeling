To create a state diagram for the Gishushu traffic light system in Rwanda, we'll consider the specific context and regulations typically observed in that region. Below is an enhanced state diagram incorporating common features and practices of traffic lights, including pedestrian signals, as they might be implemented in Gishushu.

Gishushu Traffic Light System State Diagram
States:
Green Light for Vehicles
Duration: Typically 30-60 seconds.
Pedestrian signal: Red (no crossing).
Yellow Light for Vehicles
Duration: Typically 3-5 seconds.
Pedestrian signal: Red (no crossing).
Red Light for Vehicles
Duration: Typically 30-60 seconds.
Pedestrian signal: Red (no crossing).
Pedestrian Walk Signal
Duration: Typically 10-15 seconds.
Vehicles must stop.
Pedestrian Don't Walk Signal
Duration: Typically 5-10 seconds.
Vehicles may still be stopped or preparing to go.
Transitions:
From Green to Yellow: After the green light duration.
From Yellow to Red: After the yellow light duration.
From Red to Green: After the red light duration.
From Red to Pedestrian Walk: When the vehicle light turns red.
From Pedestrian Walk to Pedestrian Don't Walk: After the pedestrian walk duration.
From Pedestrian Don't Walk to Red: When the pedestrian signal changes to donâ€™t walk, returning to the red light for vehicles.



Safety Considerations: The pedestrian signals are crucial for safety, ensuring pedestrians can cross only when it is safe.
Traffic Volume: The durations might vary based on the traffic volume and time of day.
Local Adaptations: Adjustments might be made based on local traffic patterns and regulations in Gishushu.
Technology Integration: Modern traffic lights may include sensors to adjust timings based on real-time traffic conditions.
